Spiders are arachnids known for their eight legs and ability to spin silk.
They use their silk to create intricate webs for catching prey.
Spiders are found in almost every habitat around the world.
Most spiders are harmless to humans and help control insect populations.
They have specialized mouthparts called chelicerae for feeding.
Spiders detect vibrations in their webs to sense trapped insects.
Some species hunt actively instead of building webs.
Spiders undergo molting as they grow, shedding their exoskeleton.
Their bodies are divided into two main segments: cephalothorax and abdomen.
Spiders play an important role in maintaining ecological balance.
